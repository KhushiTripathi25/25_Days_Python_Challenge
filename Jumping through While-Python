Jumping through While-Python

Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as power of 1, 2, 3.....(in increasing order).
Example
Input: x = 10
Output: 1 4 9


Code:
def printIncreasingPower(x):
    #code here
    # Loop to jump in powers of 2
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        print(i*i,end=" ")
        i = i+1
